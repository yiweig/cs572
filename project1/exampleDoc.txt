MIGRANT SEEKS AN END TO BEATINGS, ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Candido Salas says he isn't the first migrant worker to be kidnaped, beaten and 
humiliated outside two brothers' rural Carlsbad grocery store. But if he gets 
his way, he will be the last. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, as he waited for a day job outside the Country Store on El Camino 
Real, the 26-year-old migrant worker was allegedly handcuffed and punched 
several times by store owner Rickey Joe Ryberg and his brother Randy -- in what 
police have said may have been an attempt to scare migrants from the market. 
</P>
<P>
After handcuffing Salas to a railing behind the store for two hours, police 
said, the Rybergs bound the migrant worker's hands and feet with duct tape. 
They then put a brown paper bag over his head. On the bag, they scrawled "No 
Mas Aqui," or ungrammatical Spanish for "Don't Come Back," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He may not speak English or even live in the United States legally, but Salas 
believes he and other migrant laborers deserve better treatment. So he is 
pressing the prosecution of the brothers, who last week were charged with 
kidnaping, false imprisonment, battery and civil-rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've asked them for justice," he said of police and prosecutors. "We've told 
them that we're illegals but that we don't deserve to be treated like this. 
We're people. We're not animals." 
</P>
<P>
But these days, the parking lot of the market they call "La Gallina" for the 
large fiberglass rooster perched on its roof, has become a dangerous place to 
seek work, Salas and other migrants say. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Ryberg brothers have repeatedly harassed migrant workers 
who congregate outside their store, laborers contend. 
</P>
<P>
The Rybergs are suspected of randomly abducting at least three other laborers 
besides Salas and giving them the same harsh treatment -- a paper bag placed 
over their heads after they were beaten, handcuffed and held for hours against 
their will, the victims said. 
</P>
<P>
Migrant workers say as many as four others have been kidnaped by the brothers 
-- who police say are both over 6 foot 4 and weigh more than 220 pounds each -- 
but were spared the indignation of wearing the paper bag. One worker returned 
to Mexico after his arm was reportedly broken. 
</P>
<P>
The Rybergs have also chastised potential employers who drove up to their 
leased grocery-store lot, workers say. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, neither brother would comment on the alleged attacks. 
</P>
<P>
But Carlsbad police say they are investigating several new complaints of 
assaults against migrants outside the store -- reported by laborers who were 
apparently too timid to come forward before. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I'm hearing," Detective Richard Castaneda said of the alleged 
kidnapings and attacks. "We've talked with several migrants who told us what 
supposedly went on. The whole works is still under investigation. But it will 
all come out in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several laborers have forsaken the once-popular street corner near 
the Rybergs' store to look for work elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Salas, on the advice of Carlsbad police, now avoids the store. Instead, he 
walks to a convenience store near Interstate 5. On Tuesday morning, before he 
reported to a nearby job site to pick tomatoes for $5 an hour, he spoke of his 
determination to take the brothers to court. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to prosecute because if we let this case go, they might one day kill 
one of my companions," said Salas, a slight man who barely weighs 100 pounds. 
"If we stop here, the police won't pay any more attention to us. They'll say 
we're not serious enough to pursue these cases." 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda said he is impressed by the resolve demonstrated by the migrant 
worker: 
</P>
<P>
"I sense that, after his lead, these people are getting to the point where 
they're going to start coming out of the woodwork to tell us what has been 
happening up there." 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad police also are looking into a report by migrant workers that a U.S. 
Border Patrol agent, who arrived at the market before Carlsbad police, saw that 
Salas had been tied up but left the scene without taking any action after 
talking with one of the Ryberg brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Swofford, a spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol, said his agency had not 
yet been contacted by Carlsbad police and would not say whether an in-house 
investigation of the incident would be initiated. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were," he said, "I wouldn't be able to talk about it, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Salas, who left his wife and two preschool children in Mexico four months ago 
to find work in the United States, said he has already paid a price for the 
kidnaping. Now, he must seek work at a location known to fewer bosses, while 
watching many of his friends return to the Country Store. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where you go to find work," he said. "That's where all the big bosses 
come." 
</P>
<P>
But Candido Salas will have his day in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain why it happened," he said of the alleged kidnaping and 
repeated violence. "We're not shoplifters. We go into the store, the Mexicans 
and Guatemalans, and we buy more things than the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"But they still treat us rough. They push us around. They wouldn't even give us 
a place to stand in from the rain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way they treated us. It's an injustice."

MAYOR'S MOTIVES SPAWN FRENZIED DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stunned by Mayor Maureen O'Connor's announcement that she will not seek 
reelection in 1992, local civic leaders spent much of Tuesday speculating on 
the motives for her surprising decision even as they began assessing how it 
dramatically alters the city's political horizon. 
</P>
<P>
It ranks as one of the central ironies of O'Connor's 3 1/2-year-old mayoralty 
that her planned early retirement -- announced during Monday's annual State of 
the City address -- has spawned more frenzied debate and wide-ranging 
interpretations than perhaps anything else that she has done since becoming the 
city's first woman mayor in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, the 43-year-old O'Connor reaffirmed that she plans to 
step down in order to be better-positioned to campaign for the sweeping 
political and City Hall ethical reforms that she proposed in her Monday speech 
-- changes that, among other things, would move the city closer to a 
strong-mayor form of government by giving the mayor veto power over City 
Council actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the changes I'm proposing to be the issue -- not my motives," O'Connor 
said. "Since I'm not going to be the long-range beneficiary of these changes, 
critics won't be able to say that I'm power hungry or just out to strengthen 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Some San Diego leaders wondered aloud Tuesday, however, whether additional 
factors influenced her decision. A few O'Connor allies suggested that her 
growing disdain with an increasingly fractious council and personal 
distractions -- notably, the fact that her father recently suffered a serious 
stroke and her husband's long-time leukemia -- may have played a role in her 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, meanwhile, speculated that O'Connor was simply becoming disenchanted 
-- or simply bored -- with a job in which she has been consistently criticized 
for lacking a long-range vision for the city and for inattention to many of the 
major problems facing the city, as well as for other perceived shortcomings. In 
a recent report card in San Diego Political Watch, a monthly newsletter, 
O'Connor was ranked last overall among the council members. A recent San Diego 
Union review also showed that O'Connor had the worst attendance record on the 
council last year -- repeating a pattern seen late in her tenure as a 
councilwoman in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's declaration of non-candidacy also was interpreted by her foes as an 
effort to position herself above the political fray in anticipation of future 
council battles. 
</P>
<P>
"She's trying to stake out the moral high ground," Councilman Bob Filner, who 
has clashed often with O'Connor, said Tuesday. "For the next three years, 
she'll say, 'I'm not running again -- my motives are pure.' But any time any of 
us disagrees with her, she'll say we're politically motivated or that we're 
just after her job. I see a couple of horrendous years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Saying simply, "I'm the only one who really knows," O'Connor dismisses all 
those theories as "total non-factors" in her decision, which she insists stems 
primarily from her strong support for a two-term limit on local elective 
office. Though her first term was a shortened one -- the uncompleted term of 
former Mayor Roger Hedgecock, who resigned after his 1985 campaign-law 
conviction -- O'Connor said she felt that her push for a two-term limit on 
council and mayoral service would have been weakened if she herself sought a 
third term. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the circumstances, a third term was was a very tempting idea to 
play around with, but I finally decided it's better to leave after 6 1/2 years 
than 10 1/2," O'Connor said. "One of the things I like least about politics -- 
and something I think has turned off a lot of people -- is that so many 
officeholders try to hang on forever. We need new blood and new ideas in local 
government. So, I'm going to lead by example." 
</P>
<P>
Among O'Connor's confidants, there was greater surprise over the timing of her 
announcement -- which comes 2 1/2 years before the next mayoral primary and 
with nearly three years remaining in her term -- than over its content. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been hinting for some time that she was leaning this way, so it doesn't 
come as a shock," said land-use attorney Paul Peterson, one of O'Connor's 
closest advisers. "She might have preferred to wait longer to make her 
announcement, but I think the timing was dictated by her desire to campaign for 
these reforms without having it look like she was trying to feather her own 
nest." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the two-term limits and mayoral veto, O'Connor also proposed other 
fundamental changes that would reshape, in both form and content, local 
campaigns and officeholders' behavior at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's recommendations -- which she hopes to put before voters this spring 
on a special mail ballot -- include expansion of the council from eight to 10 
seats, barring council members from voting on projects involving contributors 
from whom they have received more than $1,000 in the past year, confining 
political fund-raising to nine months before a campaign and requiring 
candidates to eliminate campaign debts within 30 days after an election. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the last time that a mail ballot was used in a citywide election -- 
the 1981 convention center campaign -- O'Connor's husband, multimillionaire 
businessman Robert O. Peterson, challenged its constitutionality, suing the 
city all the way to the state Supreme Court, which upheld the electoral 
method's legality. Emphasizing that she prefers mail ballots because they 
encourage higher turnouts, O'Connor said wryly: "My husband and I disagree on 
this, but I guess I should thank him for taking care of the legal questions." 
</P>
<P>
The need for the proposed structural and ethical changes included in her reform 
package has been accelerated, O'Connor argued, by the advent of district 
elections in council campaigns. As the only member of the council still elected 
citywide, the mayor needs additional powers to better balance citywide 
interests against district concerns, O'Connor contends. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, we've got a system of government that simply doesn't work any 
more in San Diego," O'Connor said. "Without these changes, the problems of the 
'80s will be unsolved in the '90s. I want to give people a new government and 
process they can be excited about. When only 25% of the registered voters 
bother to go to the polls, that's a pretty strong indictment of the system we 
have now." 
</P>
<P>
Though O'Connor views her non-candidacy as strengthening her lobbying efforts 
for the proposed changes, others suggested that it could have the opposite 
effect by transforming her into a lame duck with ever-diminishing clout both 
inside and outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone has to worry about Maureen becoming a lame duck," 
responded San Diego Unified Port Commissioner Lou Wolfsheimer, a longtime 
O'Connor confidant. "Just because you're going to be leaving in three years 
doesn't mean you can't be effective, especially if you're the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor added: "That's the old thinking of the past. All the way from Eastern 
Europe to San Diego, reform is in the air, and if we want a new San Diego 
Spring, we'd better spring right up there with reforms. That thinking is 
obsolete. Actually, I think I'll be stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even some O'Connor opponents concur with her analysis that she 
probably had to remove herself as a future mayoral candidate in order to 
effectively push for adoption of her proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that the only way San Diego is ever going to get a strong mayor is 
to have a lame duck campaigning for it," said political consultant Tom Shepard, 
who helped manage the 1983 campaign in which Hedgecock narrowly defeated 
O'Connor. Indeed, when then-Mayor Pete Wilson sought to strengthen the mayor's 
office in the 1970s, his plan was soundly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
While O'Connor's announcement may be tantamount to the opening bell in the 1992 
mayoral campaign, most of the potential candidates whose names are included in 
the early line on the race agree that it is premature to even begin most 
behind-the-scenes politicking. In addition, most confront more immediate 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Three possible mayoral contenders -- Councilmen Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson 
and Filner -- face 1991 reelection campaigns that will mark their first taste 
of district-only races. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, former San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch must first try to win 
this spring's special 78th Assembly District race before possibly turning his 
attention to an office that he has flirted with in the past. And county 
Supervisor Susan Golding, who carefully weighed the possibility of challenging 
O'Connor in 1988 before opting to seek reelection to her own seat, realizes 
that her own political future could be affected by the outcome in the spring 
trial of her husband, businessman Richard T. Silberman, on federal 
money-laundering changes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're thinking of running in 1992, probably the best thing you could do 
right now is to concentrate on doing a good job at what you're already doing," 
political consultant Jim Johnston said. "It's a little early to be collecting 
checks." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more to the point, as O'Connor herself noted, if her campaign and 
ethics reform package wins public approval, the size of those checks and the 
manner in which they are collected could change the dynamics of the 1992 race. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a new game with new rules the next time around," O'Connor said.

CITY COUNCIL REJECTS BAN ON ALCOHOL; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: AMID HARSH CRITICISM OF EACH OTHER, MEMBERS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT 
THE INITIAL PLAN TO END DRINKING AT PARKS AND BEACHES WAS ILL-CONCEIVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday unanimously rejected the idea of banning 
alcohol consumption at all city parks and beaches, saying an initial effort at 
a blanket restriction was ill-conceived and a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The council said it will work toward a compromise to balance the rights of 
law-abiding citizens who enjoy a few drinks at the beach without bothering 
others, while protecting residents who feel under siege by a minority of 
drinkers who become drunk, abusive and noisy and at times commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But before the council voted to send the matter back to its Public Facilities 
and Recreation Committee -- which ignited an uproar last month when it 
unanimously approved the outright ban without notifying the public -- there was 
a spirited debate among several council members, who questioned one another's 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Filner, chairman of the committee that recommended the ban, 
apologized for the haste and acknowledged that more work is needed and that the 
restriction on alcohol was only one part of an overall plan. He noted that the 
committee had scheduled a meeting for today to refine the package, and he 
accused Mayor Maureen O'Connor of "grandstanding" by usurping the committee and 
scheduling Tuesday's hearing before the entire council. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who opposed the ban, defended her actions, saying the committee's 
vote caught everyone by surprise and that citizens had deluged her office with 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who opposed it weren't notified," O'Connor said. "This has caused 
so much confusion" that the entire council was needed to provide direction. 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning Filner by name, Councilman John Hartley, a member of the 
committee, said he was disappointed that O'Connor had tried to "embarrass 
somebody" and accused her of being "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset at the circus quality (of the hearing that is) designed to put 
someone on the spot or embarrass somebody," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
But the harshest rhetoric was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to many opponents of the ban, including the Old Mission Beach 
Athletic Club, which presented the council with 7,000 signatures it said were 
gathered mainly in Mission Beach and Pacific Beach, Councilman Bruce Henderson 
stunned some of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who represents those communities, said that even though he voted for 
the ban as a committee member, he was really against it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cry of desperation," he said, explaining his vote. He said he voted 
for the ban because he knew there would be an outcry, and the public would then 
force the council to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
After sitting through 2 1/2 hours of debate and hearing from dozens of citizens 
and community groups, an angry Councilman Wes Pratt responded to Henderson. 
While agreeing that a ban "might be overkill," Pratt said that what he really 
had a problem with "is a council member" whose intent was to make a political 
statement and "jerk" people around. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Henderson," the usually mild-mannered Pratt said, "if Custer had retreated 
as fast as you did on this issue, he would have made it, he'd be alive." Pratt 
said it was "inexcusable" and "irresponsible" to force people to take time off 
from their jobs to attend the council meeting when it wasn't necessary, and 
that everyone on the council knows the real problem is a lack of police 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who serves on the committee with Henderson, jumped 
in and defended him. 
</P>
<P>
She said Henderson made it clear last month that he was supporting the ban 
because alternatives -- such as arresting and jailing people who break existing 
nighttime booze bans or are rowdy -- are unrealistic because people charged 
with misdemeanors are routinely rejected at the county's overcrowded jails. 
</P>
<P>
But Pratt was unmollified. 
</P>
<P>
"You manipulated the people to deal with a particular problem," he said, his 
voice rising. 
</P>
<P>
New Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt then said she "echoed a lot of what Mr. Pratt 
has to say," adding that, during her short stint on the council, "sometimes . . 
. it's very embarrassing to say I'm a member of this council." 
</P>
<P>
Manipulated or not, nearly a full house showed up at the council chambers for 
the debate on the issue. Several people living near La Jolla Shores or in 
Mission Beach blamed alcohol use for many of their neighborhoods' problems, 
from noise and rowdiness to petty crime and public drunkenness. They called for 
support of a booze ban. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Moore, a Mission Beach resident, said drunks and overuse of alcohol have 
driven families away from the beach, particularly in the past few years. "A 
California sunset without alcohol is still a beautiful sunset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At least on this day, however, the ban's supporters were outnumbered by foes. 
Both organized groups that sponsor traditional beach-side events and 
individuals complained that they were being penalized for the behavior of a 
relatively small number of people. 
</P>
<P>
Even former Oakland Raiders defensive end Ben Davidson, who is perhaps now more 
famous for his role in the ubiquitous "Tastes great, less filling" TV beer 
commercials for a light beer, came from his La Mesa home to implore the council 
not to take "a step in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
Joined in opposition were such seemingly disparate groups as the Old Mission 
Beach Athletic Club, which sponsors the summertime revelry known as the 
Over-the-Line Tournament on Fiesta Island, and the San Diego Symphony, which 
said a ban would impinge on its Summer Pops concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups that lined up against the ban included sponsors of the annual 
spring Crew Classic on Mission Bay; the Unlimited Hydroplane Race, also held on 
Mission Bay, and the St. Patrick's Day Parade, which afterward holds a festival 
in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Fox of the Irish Congress, the parade's sponsor, said a third of his 
group's budget comes from the sale of beer at the festival, which he said has 
never had alcohol-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
All the groups said that whatever the council does, it should make exemptions 
for organized groups that police their own events. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the groups, there were other residents who said they work hard 
during the week, obey the laws, and enjoy drinking a wine cooler or beer at the 
beach without causing an incident or infringing on the rights of others. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts said it should be clear to the council that passing 
another law won't solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't deprive many people of legitimate recreational activities that 
include alcohol," he said. Roberts, like others on the council, said that 
what's needed is more enforcement of laws already in existence to curb alcohol 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer said she is adamant about placing alcohol 
restrictions at popular La Jolla Shores and adjacent Kellogg Park, including 
banning alcohol on the beach and parking lots, closing the parking lots at 10 
p.m., and restricting the size of fires in beach fire rings. 
</P>
<P>
Filner said his committee will work at creating a comprehensive program to deal 
with beach and park safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We're wrestling with a whole program to deal with inappropriate behavior at 
the beaches. . . . It was our responsibility to look at the ban," he said. 
"There is no magic answer."

MCCARTHY'S DRUG PROJECT GREETED WITH SKEPTICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy got a skeptical reception Tuesday from some students 
at a Van Nuys school for the physically and emotionally disabled over his 
proposal to raise the state sales tax to fight drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy asked about 75 junior and senior high school-age students of The HELP 
Group -- a private nonprofit school and therapy center -- their opinions on 
whether after-school recreation and classroom drug prevention programs would 
reduce the number of students who use illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The school recreation and education programs are two provisions included in an 
initiative McCarthy is sponsoring for the November ballot that seeks to raise 
the 6% state sales tax one-half cent. Supporters of McCarthy's initiative must 
gather 372,000 signatures of registered voters by May to qualify for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $1.6 billion a year earned by the tax hike would be earmarked for 
more police and prisons, and drug prevention classes beginning in kindergarten 
for every student in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug abuse is the No. 1 problem in California," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students expressed doubts over McCarthy's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you have an after-school program or are out on the streets, you're 
going to run into drugs," said one young man. 
</P>
<P>
Another student suggested that illegal drugs be made legal and then taxed, with 
proceeds going to drug rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
"People can get 'crack' anytime they want it anyway," said a young man to 
McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy asked: "You're saying, no matter what we do, people will use drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the young man replied. 
</P>
<P>
Many students said they agreed with McCarthy's assessment during the nearly 
hourlong question and answer session in the school's auditorium. But, they 
explained some of the reasons they believe young people use drugs: boredom, 
peer pressure, emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Other students asked McCarthy why more money isn't going to drug treatment 
programs. About 8% of the proposed sales tax increase would go to such 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs more than $650 a day to go to drug treatment, so that only the rich 
people can afford it, not the poor people who are the ones using 'crack,' " 
said one young woman, who cannot be identified because of state laws protecting 
the identity of those who attend schools for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Some students said drug prevention lessons explain the dangers of drug abuse. 
But many youngsters decide to experiment with drugs despite the warnings 
because, said one student, "People think, 'So what if it kills me, my life 
isn't going anywhere right now.' "

VENTURA BOULEVARD TRAFFIC GETS RELIEF, BUT IT MAY NOT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Traffic along the entire 17-mile length of Ventura Boulevard within the city of 
Los Angeles should flow more smoothly with the recent start-up of a computer 
system that controls the timing of traffic lights, a city transportation 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the relief may only be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
City Department of Transportation engineer John Fisher said all 82 
intersections with traffic lights along the boulevard were put on the 
computerized system on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Similar systems operating elsewhere in the city have increased the number of 
cars a street can carry by 7% while reducing traffic delays by as much as 20%, 
Fisher said. "It results in a smoother flow of traffic in the aggregate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for boulevard motorists, completion of the computerized traffic 
signal project along Ventura Boulevard comes as Caltrans prepares to begin the 
final phase of its widening of the Ventura Freeway. That traffic-snarling 
project will force many motorists off the freeway and onto Ventura Boulevard, 
erasing many of the traffic flow gains realized by the computerized system. 
</P>
<P>
"Once lanes are closed on the freeway due to the widening project and commuters 
get on the boulevard, some of the benefits of the computerized system will be 
lost temporarily," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's comments came after he testified before the Los Angeles City Council's 
Budget and Finance Committee about the transportation department's request for 
interim funding to pay for the design of a computerized signal project for more 
than 320 additional intersections in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The full system for the Valley, which is scheduled for completion in February, 
1992, at a cost of $20.7 million, would cover all intersections from Victory 
Boulevard on the north to Ventura Boulevard on the south and from Valley Circle 
Boulevard on the west to Lankershim Boulevard on the east. 
</P>
<P>
The computer system, which relies on video cameras and traffic sensors embedded 
in the roadway to monitor traffic flow, is officially called the Automated 
Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) project. Similar systems are in 
operation in downtown Los Angeles and around the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The final, 51-intersection leg of the Ventura Boulevard phase of the project 
was completed two days before a deadline urged by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar). Katz wanted the ATSAC system installed along Ventura Boulevard 
before the freeway-widening project began and had been critical in the past of 
city efforts to complete the system.

DEFENDANT DENIES MAILING LETTERS IN 'PAY OR DIE' SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
After more than a year in jail and several weeks of trial testimony, a former 
Lancaster aerospace worker took the witness stand in San Fernando Superior 
Court on Tuesday for the first time and denied mailing extortion letters to 
hundreds of prominent Antelope Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Faroni's testimony painted the prosecution's case as being built on 
misinterpretation of innocent acts. 
</P>
<P>
The "pay-or-die" letters mailed in late 1988 demanded millions of dollars, but 
no money was ever collected. Faroni, 27, was charged along with 28-year-old 
Roman Makuch with attempted extortion and conspiracy, based on evidence of 
surveillance and other activities that prosecutors portrayed as incriminating. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald S. Coen rejected a motion to dismiss the case two weeks ago, 
saying the prosecution had convinced him the defendants are guilty. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Faroni contradicted prosecution testimony that he bragged about an 
ongoing surveillance project, saying he conducted surveillance activity only 
once when he used a camera and tape recorder to spy on a neighbor with whom he 
was feuding. And he denied owning a long-range listening device known as a "big 
ears," which a neighbor said he saw the defendants load into a car before 
late-night drives, during which prosecutors believe they gathered information 
on victims. 
</P>
<P>
Faroni said he owned an old-fashioned flashbulb holder that could be mistaken 
as a long-range microphone. He also testified that he never heard of some of 
the prominent letter recipients -- including two well-known hotel owners and a 
Lancaster businessman who is the chairman of the state Republican Party -- 
until after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get into politics," Faroni said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven L. Cooley has asserted that Faroni and Makuch had a 
motive for the extortion plot because they were angry that local leaders had 
failed to support the Antelope Valley Film Commission, on which they worked as 
volunteers. 
</P>
